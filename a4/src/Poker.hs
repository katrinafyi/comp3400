but no others.

Suppose the following datatype for representing a standard deck of cards and
    data Suit = Hearts | Clubs | Diamonds | Spades deriving (Eq, Ord)
    data Rank = Numeric Int | Jack | Queens | King | Ace deriving (Eq, Ord)
    data Card = NormalCard Rank Suit | Joker deriving Eq

Your task is to determine the HAND RANKING of hand :: List[Card].  The HAND
RANKINGS in DESCENDING ORDER is given by:
    FiOAK -- five of a kind
    StFl  -- straight flush
    FoOAK -- four of a kind
    FuHo  -- full house
    Fl    -- flush
    St    -- straight
    TrOAK -- three of a kind
    TwPr  -- two pair
    OnPr  -- one pair
    HiCa  -- high card
where the definitions of the above are here: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poker_hands
(Ignore the (**) note that says "Category does not exist under ace-to-five low rules")

Supposing
    data HandRanking = FiOAK | StFl | FoOAK | FuHo | Fl | St | TrOAK | TwPr | OnPr | HiCa deriving (Show, Eq, Ord)
write a function 
    ranking :: (Card, Card, Card, Card, Card) -> HandRanking
that returns the GREATEST ranking among a hand of cards.


NOTES:

1/  Do *not* assume hands are drawn from a standard deck.  That is, presume any 
    card can appear in duplicate.  In particular, assume any hand can have an 
    arbitrary numbers of jokers in it.

2/  An Ace can be considered to have numeric rank 1 for the purposes of 
    forming a straight or straight flush.

EXAMPLE
> ranking (Joker, Joker, Joker, Joker, Joker)
FiOAK

> ranking ((NormalCard Ace Hearts),
    (NormalCard (Numeric 2) Hearts),
    (NormalCard (Numeric 3) Hearts),
    (NormalCard (Numeric 4) Hearts),
    (NormalCard (Numeric 5) Hearts))
StFl

> ranking (Joker,
    (NormalCard (Numeric 2) Hearts),
    (NormalCard (Numeric 2) Spades),
    (NormalCard (Numeric 3) Hearts),
    Joker)
FoOAK
-- NOT FuHo because Full House has lower rank.
